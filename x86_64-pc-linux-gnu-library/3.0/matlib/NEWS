matlib 0.7.2

  - added argument `error.sphere` to `plot.regvec3d()` [JF]
  - remove use of `lengths()` in `corner()` to avoid R version dependency


matlib 0.7.0

  - use `corner()` in vectors3d.Rd
  - added `arc()` for 2D, 3D vector diagrams to show angles between vectors
  - added `regvec3d()` for 2D, 3D vector diagrams representing a bivariate multiple regression model, `lm(y ~ x1 + x2)` [thx: John Fox]
  - added internal `.arrows()` to produce nice arrows in 2D `vector()` diagrams
  - fixed numerous small problems in vector diagrams
  - fixed some erroneous statements in vignettes
  - `showEqn()` now aligns terms vertically and prints without quotes
  - reversed sense of `absolute` in `points_on_line()` and clarified documentation

matlib 0.6.0

  - added `vandermode()` function
  - added `vec()` convenience function to vectorize a matrix
  - added `is_square_matrix()` tests
  - added `power_method()`, power method for dominant eigenvector [thx: Gaston Sanchez]
  - added `arrows3d()` for 3D geometric diagrams
  - added `vectors3d()` for 3D geometric diagrams
  - added `corner()` for 2D, 3D geometric diagrams
  - added more documentation content to `man/matlib.Rd` from `README.md`


matlib 0.5.2

  - added `swp()` function
  - added `vignette("gramreg")` - *Gram-Schmidt Orthogonalization and Regression*

matlib 0.5.1

  - added `len()` convenience function for Euclidean lengths
  - added `plotEqn3d()` function using `rgl` to plot equations in 3 unknowns
  - reorganized `matlib.R` to become a package .Rd document
  - renamed `proj()` -> `Proj()` to avoid conflict with `stats::proj()`
  - added `vectors()` for plotting geometric diagrams
  - added vignette("linear-equations") - *Solving Linear Equations*
